Data set for the paper submitted to PLOS One, which is entitled "Gastric Precancerous Diseases Classification Using CNN with a Concise Model".

This dataset includes 3 types of gastric precancerous diseases, namely, erosion, polyp and ulcer. 
The dataset is divided into train images and var images. For detail description, please search our corresponding paper.

Attention: 

We have developed a website for gastric precancerous diseases classification using the method proposed in our paper. The URL is  https://miva.vico-lab.com:8443/classify-demo/.

This website is just a demo for explaining our paper more clearly. It has a basic function of prediction. You can upload any image with any size for a classifying result. However, we strongly recommend that the users should upload the images related with gastroscopy, because our model is for 3 types of gastric precancerous diseases classification, namely, erosion, polyp and ulcer.


HOW TO USE THE WEBSITE:


First step: upload an image. (We have also upload some test images (images not used in our paper) for this website. These images are contained in the folder named "images_for_website" on this github.)

Second step: click "classify" and wait for the result.



This website classifies images using CPU, which may cost a few seconds for prediction.
